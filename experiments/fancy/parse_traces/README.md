# Pcap parse scripts

In this directory, you will find some utilities to download and preprocess pcap traces.

- `download_traces.py` and `download_timestamps.py` can be used to automatically download 1h traces.
- `pcap_parse.py` has a set of functions to parse `pcaps` and `time` files to generate digests used by our simulator.
